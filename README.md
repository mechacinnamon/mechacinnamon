## GET TO KNOW ME PLEASE !
- 👋 Hi, I’m a self-taught developer with a little bit of a university background , but then i left it because of a trauma i've come to have.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning kotlin and android development but i also have a little background in Java which i studied in university.
- 🥰 I just love learning especially with some books or a well-structured youtube video series, a little less with websites or apps but i am trying to do that also.
